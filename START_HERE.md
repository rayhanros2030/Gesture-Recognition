# 👋 START HERE - Gesture Recognition Demo

Welcome! This is a **simple, ready-to-use demo** for gesture recognition.

## 🎯 What Is This?

A standalone demo that lets you see hand detection and basic gesture recognition in action - **no training, no models, no datasets needed!**

## ⚡ Quick Start (Under 2 Minutes!)

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
python setup_demo.py
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Demo

```bash
python demo_gesture_detection.py
```

### 3️⃣ Show Your Hand!

- Make different gestures (fist, peace, open hand, etc.)
- Watch the landmarks appear in real-time
- See gesture names displayed

That's it! 🎉

## 🎓 Learning Path

### For Complete Beginners:
1. **Start**: `demo_gesture_detection.py` (this demo)
2. **Learn**: Basic MediaPipe hand tracking
3. **Explore**: Modify finger counting logic
4. **Read**: The commented code to understand concepts

### For Advanced Users:
1. **Train Models**: Use training scripts
2. **Capture Data**: Record your own gesture datasets
3. **Build System**: Integrate with `Model_Altogether.py`
4. **Customize**: Add your own gestures and actions

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to train anything?**  
A: Not for the demo! Just run it.

**Q: Will it work on my computer?**  
A: Yes! Windows, Mac, Linux - all supported.

**Q: What if my camera doesn't work?**  
A: Make sure no other app is using your camera.

**Q: Can I add custom gestures?**  
A: The demo uses simple finger counting. For custom gestures, use the full project.

**Q: Is this different from the main project?**  
A: Yes! This is a simplified version that works immediately without any training.
